# NucleicAcidsQM
Research and development code for MM and QM modelling on nucleic acids.

(1) Run main.R  
a) DNA model generation according to sequence.txt.  
b) Molecular mechanics (MM) and semi-quantum mechanical (QM) optimization.  
c) Single point calculation and Curves+ calculation for electronic and geometric features.  
d) Summary of features are put at ./data directory.  

(2) Run compile_data.R  
Extract and complie features obtained from the above calculation.  
Obtained datas are put at ./compiled_data directory.
